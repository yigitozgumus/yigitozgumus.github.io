    "year 2020 was actually quite a journey. I joined Commencis as a Software Engineer and started working on the Pegasus Team. \n",
    "Then the Covid-19 pandemic came out of nowhere and our still ongoing work from home period has begun. \n",
    "For almost 1 year (6th of January is the exact milestone) I have been working at Commencis. It has been a quite exciting journey and I learned\n",
    "so much about how to develop a product and what agile software development really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "My 2021 Resolutions revolve around growing and learning more as an engineer and honing my skills even more. \n",
    "Working with 20+ plus team at Commencis showed me how much communication is really important during design, \n",
    "development and testing stages of our work. So I want to write more to this website and become more comfortable around writing to communicate. \n",
    "It's one of my weak points and I want to throw myself out there to learn, spartan style :)\n"
