I am very happy to say that after 2 years of courses, exams and rollercoaster of an experience, I completed 
my master's degree. My thesis is called Adversarially Learned Anomaly Detection Using Generative Adversarial Networks.
You can check out the <a href="https://www.github.com/yigitozgumus/Polimi_Thesis">project repository</a> and the thesis itself. 

I will plan my next steps and continue to pursue my interest. More content to come!
