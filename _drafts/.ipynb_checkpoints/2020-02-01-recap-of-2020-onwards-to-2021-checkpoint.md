I haven't posted anything new this past year. Other than the fact that the whole world faced an epidemic 
which we only accustomed to see on tv shows and post apocalyptic movies, 
I was particularly being lazy and procastinated most of my plans regarding to this website. Despite the lack of posts,
year 2020 was actually quite a journey. I joined Commencis as a Software Engineer and started working on the Pegasus Team. 
Then the Covid-19 pandemic came out of nowhere and our still ongoing work from home period has begun.
