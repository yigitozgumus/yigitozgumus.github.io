Hello there!

My name is YiÄŸit. I am a computer engineer with a passion to learn new things and design cool stuff.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Commencis](https://www.commencis.com), building mobile
applications.
Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/) then graduated from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) with master of science in Computer science and engineering.

The main reason I choose to be a computer engineer is the basic cliche notion that we, engineers, 
could build anything. That's hardly the truth. We can, but there is soooo much to learn to be able to do it **properly**.
At some times people may see this as *the occupational hazard* since your mind constantly need to be on the look out to keep up with the latest advancements, frameworks, papers, tools and technologies. Of course you can choose not to do that but where is the fun in that ? This reminds me of a quote I frequently remind myself.
> The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.
>
> Albert Einstein

I believe willing to learn anything and being humble about the things you don't know is the key. And I try to apply this core value to every area in my life.

What else ? Well, I love to run and occasionaly draw stuff. Running was once a goal for me to reach as an indicative to a healthier life but it became a habit I couldn't shake it off.

 Here is to the year 2017 when I ran every day (almost) and documented it.

 And of course I love a good cup of coffee.

In this website you will hopefully see a glimpse of what I've been upto in my software career and the things I am curios to learn. I tried to take up writing about stuff many times but failed miserably. Believe me, writing this about me page surprised me, like a lot.
